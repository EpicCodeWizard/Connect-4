# 🚧 What It Does
This `python` script allows you to play `Connect 4`, inside a terminal.

# 📓 How We Built It
Our team really likes the console. It's simple, easily manipulable, and really fun to work with. We never knew you could use colors in it, but once we found out, we *forced* ourselves to make a colorful board. After **long** time of coding, we finally finished it.

# 👨🏾‍💻 Challenges We Ran Into
We ran into many issues, ranging from input, to coloring, to game logic. In the end, we finally solved everything, though, and the final product isn't too different from what we expected.

# 📙 What We Learned
We learned a lot in this project. Most off all, we learned `ANSI escape sequence codes`. We never even knew color in the *black and white* console was possible. After some research, and a lot of ***long and boring*** work, we figured out how to display a colored board, center it on the screen, and still receive input. *Credits to [Linny](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/153917/linny), from StackExchange, for help on the code to check/get diagonals.*

# 🔜 What's Next for Connect 4
We will add a better way to start and end the games. We will also add a better way to play the game, like a guide.

# 🎲 How to Play
You play pieces by `enter`. To move between columns, use the `left and right arrow keys`. Once the game is over, just stop and rerun the program!
